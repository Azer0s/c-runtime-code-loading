# C runtime code loading with mmap(2)

With this sandbox project I just want to toy around with using mmap(2) with PROT_EXEC. This can be used for JIT compilation in interpreters, writing a barebones plugin system and much more. Truth be told, I just wanna find out a bit more about interesting Linux syscalls and mmap(2) seemed to be one of them.
